Writing testable code
=====================

---
template: intro
name: intro

And then testing it
-------------------

name: whoami

Who am I?
---------
- PHP developer for > 3 years

---

So first, some terms
====================
And concepts too
----------------

---

Application
-----------
The project you work on. It has **requirements** and your job is to write
enough code that it fulfills those requirements.

Testing
-------
That's when you prove your application does what you want it to do.

>Note: You probably (hopefully?) do this all the time

---

Manual testing
--------------
That's when you (or some other human being) tests your application.

Automated testing
-----------------
That's when you use another script or utility to test your application.

>Note: Computers are usually much faster at testing than humans.

---

Unit tests
----------
These are tests that only check one small piece (a unit) of your application.

>Note: Only computers can really do this type of test.

Integration tests
-----------------
These are tests that check the whole application all at once.

>Note: This is the type of test most people usually do themselves.

---
name: integrationtestssuck

Integration tests are the most realistic
----------------------------------------

---
template: integrationtestssuck
name: integrationtestssuck

They're also the worst
----------------------

---
template: integrationtestssuck
name: integrationtestssuck

Why?

---
template: integrationtestssuck
name: integrationtestssuck

- Could have failed anywhere in the stack

---
template: integrationtestssuck
name: integrationtestssuck

- Huge potential number of conditions (logged in, cold cache, etc)

---
template: integrationtestssuck
name: integrationtestssuck

- Can be hard to reproduce

---
name: unittestsrock

Unit tests are the best for debugging
-------------------------------------

Why?

---
template: unittestsrock
name: unittestsrock

- Known, limited number of inputs

---
template: unittestsrock
name: unittestsrock

- Drop into a REPL

---
template: unittestsrock
name: unittestsrock

- Easy to see where the problem is

---

Test suite
----------
A set of tests that you run for your application.

Can be:

- Unit

- Integration

- Both

---

Test coverage
-------------
A percent that tells you how much of your application is being tested when
you run your test suite.

- High numbers are good!

- 100% is sometimes cited as a goal

- **100% is a stupid goal**

---

Wait, what?
-----------
- 100% doesn't mean there aren't any bugs

    - Could be "testing" a line without checking all possible input types

- Our goal isn't lots of tests, our goal is reliable software

- Tests help that, but there's diminishing returns in coverage percent

---
class: center middle

Still, try to keep it > 80%
===========================

(Don't worry if it's low, just keep increasing it over time)

---
name: tdd

Test-last development
---------------------
Write your code first, then go back and write tests for it.

>Most people do this

---
template: tdd
name: tdd

Test-first development (TDD)
----------------------------
Write your tests first, then write the code that makes them pass.

---
name: tddbenefits

Test-first development produces higher quality code
---------------------------------------------------

---
template: tddbenefits
name: tddbenefits

- Changes the way you think about a task

---
template: tddbenefits
name: tddbenefits

- Forces you to craft an API before writing internals (big picture)

---
template: tddbenefits
name: tddbenefits

- Keeps your code lean

---
template: tddbenefits
name: tddbenefits

- Less likely to miss a possible test case

---
name: redgreenrefactor

"Red, green, refactor"
----------------------

The TDD process in a nutshell:

---
name: redgreenrefactor
template: redgreenrefactor

- Write failing tests

---
name: redgreenrefactor
template: redgreenrefactor


- Make those tests pass

---
template: redgreenrefactor

- Fix your code

---
name: redgreenrefactor
template: redgreenrefactor

- **Fix your code**

---
name: redgreenrefactor
template: redgreenrefactor

"Break early, break often"

---

Continuous integration
----------------------
A process that means your tests should always pass, and that you automatically
run them every time you change the code.

- Need to be able to run them locally

- Some services will run your tests for you

- Sometimes you have to pay for those services

- Travis.ci, drone.io, Jenkins, etc.

---

Breaking the build
------------------
That's when your project uses continuous integration but someone's latest
change made the tests fail.

![keep calm and don't break the build](/img/you-broke-the-build.png)

---

Deployment
----------
When you update the version of the application your customers are seeing.

>For us that mostly means putting it on the server.

---

Continuous deployment
---------------------
A natural extension of continuous integration. The application gets deployed
after any code change that doesn't break the build.

- This means that you're super confident in your test suite

- It also means you've got the deployment process automated

![witchcraft](/img/witchcraft.gif)
---

Case study: Github
------------------
>"Aug. 23, saw 563 builds and 175 deploys"

![](/img/github_deploys.png)

---

Case study: Etsy
----------------
>"At Etsy about 150 engineers deploy a single monolithic application more than
>60 times a day"

![](/img/etsy_deployment.png)

---

Benefits
--------
- Deploying quickly often keeps your changes small

- You can be confident in your changes because you know they're correct

- You know the moment something breaks, hopefully before a customer sees it

PHPUnit
-------

- De facto unit testing framework in PHP

- Fantastic tooling support

- A little verbose

---

We're testing this class
------------------------

```php
<?php # src/Calculator.php

class Calculator
{
    /**
     * Adds two numbers together
     *
     * @param int|float $x
     * @param int|float $y
     *
     * @return int|float
     */
    public function add($x, $y)
    {
        return $x + $y;
    }
}
```

---

An example PHPUnit test

```php
<?php # tests/CalculatorTest.php

class CalculatorTest extends PHPUnit_Framework_TestCase
{
    public function testAddWorks()
    {
        $calc = new Calculator();

        $this->assertEquals($calc->add(2, 2), 4);
    }
}
```

---
How do we run it?
-----------------

- Need to require it (require-dev) with composer

    ```bash
    composer require --dev phpunit/phpunit ~4.1
    ```

    ```json
    "require-dev": {
        "phpunit/phpunit": "~4.1"
    }
    ```

- And write a phpunit.xml file

    ```xml
    <phpunit bootstrap="./vendor/autoload.php">
        <testsuite name="Calculator testsuite">
            <directory>./test</directory>
        </testsuite>
    </phpunit>
    ```
---
Running it:

```
PHPUnit 4.1.1 by Sebastian Bergmann.

Configuration read from path/to/project/phpunit.xml

.

Time: 4 ms, Memory: 5.50Mb

OK (1 tests, 1 assertions)
```

---
class: center, middle

We can do better
================

---

Give it a better name with the `@test` annotation

```php
<?php # tests/CalculatorTest.php

class CalculatorTest extends PHPUnit_Framework_TestCase
{
    /**
     * @test
     */
    public function it_adds_2_and_2_together_correctly()
    {
        $calc = new Calculator();

        $this->assertEquals($calc->add(2, 2), 4);
    }
}
```

---

Checking multiple conditions? Use a `@dataProvider`

```php
<?php # tests/CalculatorTest.php

class CalculatorTest extends PHPUnit_Framework_TestCase
{
    /**
     * @dataProvider additionDataProvider
     * @test
     */
    public function it_adds_2_numbers_together_correctly($x, $y, $result)
    {
        $calc = new Calculator();

        $this->assertEquals($calc->add($x, $y), $result);
    }

    public function additionDataProvider()
    {
        return [
            "2 and 2" => [2, 2, 4],
            "3 and 1" => [3, 1, 4],
            "6 and 2" => [6, 2, 8],
        ];
    }
}
```
---

```php
PHPUnit 4.1.1 by Sebastian Bergmann.

Configuration read from /home/ciarand/presentations/writing-testable-code/code/phpunit.xml

...

Time: 41 ms, Memory: 3.75Mb

OK (3 tests, 3 assertions)
```

---
class: middle, center

How do we test units without touching the database?
---------------------------------------------------

---
Mocking!
--------

Our code under test:
```php
class Temperature
{

    public function __construct($service)
    {
        $this->_service = $service;
    }

    public function average()
    {
        $total = 0;
        for ($i = 0; $i < 3; $i++) {
            $total += $this->_service->readTemp();
        }
        return $total / 3;
    }

}
```

---
We need to test it responds to different inputs. Let's use Mockery.

```php
use \Mockery as m;

class TemperatureTest extends PHPUnit_Framework_TestCase
{

    protected function tearDown()
    {
        m::close();
    }

    public function testGetsAverageTemperatureFromThreeServiceReadings()
    {
        $service = m::mock('service');
        $service->shouldReceive('readTemp')->times(3)->andReturn(10, 12, 14);

        $temperature = new Temperature($service);

        $this->assertEquals(12, $temperature->average());
    }

}
```

---
Benefits
--------

- Mocking lets us test units in isolation

- Mocking lets us avoid time intensive tasks like DB and filesystem access

- Mocking means you can pinpoint exactly where your code is broken

        Then I should see "agile software development"

    Scenario: Searching for a page that does NOT exist
        Given I am on "/wiki/Main_Page"
        When I fill in "search" with "Glory Driven Development"
        And I press "searchButton"
        Then I should see "Search results"
```

How do we define the testing behaviors?
---------------------------------------

```gherkin
Given I am on "/wiki/Main_Page"
```

```php
/**
 * Opens specified page.
 *
 * @Given /^(?:|I )am on "(?P<page>[^"]+)"$/
 * @When /^(?:|I )go to "(?P<page>[^"]+)"$/
 */
public function visit($page)
{
    $this->getSession()->visit($this->locatePath($page));
