So first, some terms
====================
And concepts too
----------------

---

Testing
-------
That's when you make sure your computer thing does what you want it to do.

>Note: You probably (hopefully?) do this all the time

---

Automated testing
-----------------
That's when you use another computer thing to check whether your main computer
thing does what you want it to do.

>Note: Computer things are much faster at checking this stuff than human things

---

Unit tests
----------
These are tests that only check one small piece (a unit) of your computer thing.
