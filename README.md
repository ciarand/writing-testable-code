Writing Testable Code
---------------------
>A presentation on writing testable code in PHP

About the presentation
----------------------
Long gone are the days where a website's job was simple. Modern webapps are
expected to do it all - authentication, CRUD, metrics, REST, and more. With
these additional responsibilities comes a need for both testable, verifiable
code and the tests that show it.

This presentation will be focused on these 3 topics:

* Workflows, including testing tools like PHPUnit and Behat / Mink

* Writing quality tests and "gotchas" to avoid along the way

* Writing verifiable code that can be easily tested
